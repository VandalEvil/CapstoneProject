The original instructions for this project were to create code to read in data from a .csv file and store it in a data structure for efficient manipulation. The provided data was in the form of college courses and had the stipulation that if the prerequisites for any course did not exist in the data set, it was to be discarded. It was written in C++ and the data structure I used was a Binary Search Tree. Sample data was provided by the instructor, then several different sets were used to verify functionality; we were not given access to those data sets.
