**CS 340 Summary**

**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Working through this project iteratively week-to-week really helped to see how beneficial it is to work on a project in stages. It helps to see how everything goes together. At the end of each week we had working code, which works way better than stopping part of the way through the process and trying to pick up where we left off. Because of this iterative approach, keeping good comments was very important; my mind is too slippery these days to remember why I did something a certain way a week ago. The best part is that at the end of this, we have a good python backbone to work with; we could set up any kind of data set in MongoDB and use our middleware without having to start all over from scratch.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

The most important part of this course was paying attention to the resources. Everything we needed to do was outlined in the weekly resources and supplemental documentation. This was one of the first courses where we weren't given a step-by-step guide or much starter code; even the parts we were given needed to be carefully studied to understand how the pieces fit together. I appreciated having to figure out a lot of it on my own.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computers are extremely valuable tools; unfortunately, they are also not incredibly user friendly. There are many experts in many fields that can benefit from the use of computers. Computer scientists help those experts make the most out of technology, freeing them up to concern themselves with thier work, instead of having to worry about the computer part.
