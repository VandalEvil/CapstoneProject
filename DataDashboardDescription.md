The original instructions for this project were to setup a MongoDB database, develop Python middleware to interact with the database, and build out a Plotly Dash dashboard in Jupyter Notebook for the end user. The provided data set was a list of shelter animals in the Austin, Texas area, a data set with about ten thousand entries. The database was accessed through the middleware and specific types were called from buttons on the dashboard. The work for this course was done in a virtual environment; MongoDB was already set up in the environment along with Jupyter Notebook and the dashboard worked only in that local environment.
